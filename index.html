                 in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</h3>
            <h3 class="Daniel-Subtitulo">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. 
                I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, 
                working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</h3>

                no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer for a big company.
                This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself. ” </h3>

            <h3 class="Kira-Titulo">Graduate Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h3>
            <h3 class="Kira-Subtitulo">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line 
                of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming 
                step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only
                say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not 
                disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. 
                The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to 
                the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often 
                referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. 
                It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple
                offers. 100% recommend!”</h3>

                Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy. </h3>
            <h3 class="Patrick-Subtitulo">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which
                 I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be
                 able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. 
                 The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
                 an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”  </h3>
